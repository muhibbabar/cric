<div id="tab1" class="tab-content">
  A batsman may hit right-handed or left-handed. Good batting is based on a straight (i.e., vertical) bat with its full face presented to the ball, although a cross (i.e., horizontal) bat can be used effectively to deal with short bowling.
</div>
        <div id="tab2" class="tab-content">
        Bowling, in cricket, is the action of propelling the ball toward the wicket defended by a batter. A player skilled at bowling is called a bowler;[1] a bowler who is also a competent batter is known as an all-rounder. Bowling the ball is distinguished from throwing the ball by a strictly specified biomechanical definition, which restricts the angle of extension of the elbow.[2] A single act of bowling the ball towards the batter is called a ball or a delivery. Bowlers bowl deliveries in sets of six, called an over.</div>

        <div id="tab3" class="tab-content">
          Fielding refers to the act of catching, collecting and returning a ball that has been hit by the batsman. There are nine fielders on each team, as one player out of the 11 will have to act as the bowler, while another takes up the role of the wicket keeper.</div>
